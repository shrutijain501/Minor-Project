# Minor-Project
The project is a website, predicated on providing a digital platform to local shop owners
and showcases their offers digitally. It will be facile for buyers to look around the
market on a single platform and get acquainted with the trending offers.
The advantages of offline retail are well cemented. It remains the most popular
shopping channel for consumers and canâ€™t currently be matched by online when it
comes to customer experience. With a traditional bricks-and-mortar store, you can craft
a unique experience for your customers and express your brand in an ingenious way.
Even for an e-Commerce retailer, having a physical store is a brilliant way to express a
vision for your brand, sell an experience to your customers and reach incipient markets.
The Street Online website will be homogeneous to a community consisting of both
buyers and sellers. The shopkeepers who want to remain distant from the struggle of
selling products through online market can facilely flourish here
